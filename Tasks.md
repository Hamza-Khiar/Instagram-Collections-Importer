the main idea behind this app is to move all the collections by it's groups from one user account into the next user account.

## Tasks & Todos

- i'll need to do research on instagram apis and how to retrive instagram collections from either api or scraping it or something

The plan behind this Instagram collection importer is that it's linked with other stuff as well.

- Importing can be based either by importing videos by URL or importing from account a to account b.
- the user should prove that he owns both the accounts (by either logging in by Instagram pop-up or google pop-up; or provide the credentials to the website/page)
- either with a headless chrome engine or some Instagram API or selenium

- Pick which programming language you will use (typescript{bun},python,go,php)

## Steps

1) how to start the setup process of instagram client private api : (like booting the api and giving it the credentials)
2) if i should use the web interface (the graphql stuff & using the anonymous interface of communicating with the api) or the app interface (private api)
