the main idea behind this app is to move all the collections by it's groups from one user account into the next user account.

## Tasks & Todos

- i'll need to do research on instagram apis and how to retrive instagram collections from either api or scraping it or something
The plan behind this Instagram collection importer is that it's linked with other stuff as well.

- Importing can be based either by importing videos by URL or importing from account a to account b.
- the user should prove that he owns both the accounts (by either logging in by Instagram pop-up or google pop-up; or provide the credentials to the website/page)
- either with a headless chrome engine or some Instagram API or selenium

The plan behind using this is to use the collection videos & feed them into an AI that will record based on criteria provided to it to output a 3D model in blender.
